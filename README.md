## Bambang DB

A toy db that derive from sqlite, to demonstrate enhanced 'SELECT' query but will keep the original sqlite file format.
in short, just try as fast as duck db, but keep using the original sqlite file format, by utilizing : 

- Parallelism + enhanced query planner
- Efficient buffer manager + enhanced cache

This is not for production use, just for my undergraduate thesis project.
